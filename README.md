# Real-Time Sign Language Gesture Recognition

The aim of this project is to recognise American Sign Language (ASL) in real time using the webcam. It is developed in python 3.8.3 using TensorFlow, OpenCV. InceptionV3 model is used, whoch is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for classification.
